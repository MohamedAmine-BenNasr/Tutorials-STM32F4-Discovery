#### What is STM32 ?

STM32 is a 32-bit Flash microcontroller family developed by ST Microelectronics. It is based on
the ARM® Cortex®‑M processor and offers a 32‑bit product range that combines very high
performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, and low‑power, low‑voltage
operation.
A detailed description about each series, development tools and part number decoding can be
found on Wikipedia.
