# Tutorial CMX 04 PWM Output STM32F4Discovery

### PWM Output generation on STM32 Microcontrollers using HAL
In this tutorial, I will show you, how to implement PWM outputs on STM32F4xx devices. This is for a lot of people pretty hard work, but believe me, itâ€™s quite quick and easy. I will go step by step on how to make a PWM output on specific timer.

I used the following equipment:

- STM32F4 Discovery Board.
- Keil uVision 5 with the necessary packages for STM32F4 Discovery boards installed.
- STLink USB Driver.
- STM 32 CubeMX.

### STM32CubeMX 

Generating the config. files from STM32CubeMX.  

1. Open STM32CubeMX and open a new project. 
2. Select the STM32F4 Discovery from the Borards tab.
3. Set and configure the RCC (HSE) to Crystal/Ceramic Resonator.
4. Set and configure TIM4 as PWM Generation CH1 (correspond to PD12 PIN).

5. Click the configuration tab and click on the TIM4 button 
6. The TIM4 is configured in PWM 1 mode and the pulsation is 0 (the upper code is dragged into the main code), the fast mode is deactivated and the polarity is set high.

7. Go to Project > Generate code.
8. Enter a project name and select MDK-ARM V5.
9. Generate the code and open the project in Keil uVision.

The code generator should output the desired code as usual(the TIM4 and GPIO initialization functions).
``` C++
/* TIM4 init function */
static void MX_TIM4_Init(void)
{

  TIM_MasterConfigTypeDef sMasterConfig;
  TIM_OC_InitTypeDef sConfigOC;

  htim4.Instance = TIM4;
  htim4.Init.Prescaler = 0;
  htim4.Init.CounterMode = TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP;
  htim4.Init.Period = 0;
  htim4.Init.ClockDivision = TIM_CLOCKDIVISION_DIV1;
  if (HAL_TIM_PWM_Init(&htim4) != HAL_OK)
  {
    _Error_Handler(__FILE__, __LINE__);
  }

  sMasterConfig.MasterOutputTrigger = TIM_TRGO_RESET;
  sMasterConfig.MasterSlaveMode = TIM_MASTERSLAVEMODE_DISABLE;
  if (HAL_TIMEx_MasterConfigSynchronization(&htim4, &sMasterConfig) != HAL_OK)
  {
    _Error_Handler(__FILE__, __LINE__);
  }

  sConfigOC.OCMode = TIM_OCMODE_PWM1;
  sConfigOC.Pulse = 0;
  sConfigOC.OCPolarity = TIM_OCPOLARITY_HIGH;
  sConfigOC.OCFastMode = TIM_OCFAST_DISABLE;
  if (HAL_TIM_PWM_ConfigChannel(&htim4, &sConfigOC, TIM_CHANNEL_1) != HAL_OK)
  {
    _Error_Handler(__FILE__, __LINE__);
  }

  HAL_TIM_MspPostInit(&htim4);

}

/** Configure pins as 
        * Analog 
        * Input 
        * Output
        * EVENT_OUT
        * EXTI
*/
static void MX_GPIO_Init(void)
{

  /* GPIO Ports Clock Enable */
  __HAL_RCC_GPIOH_CLK_ENABLE();
  __HAL_RCC_GPIOD_CLK_ENABLE();

}
``` 

### Principle of using PWM signals
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a periodic signal with a fixed frequency. User need to adjust the width of the pulse (i.e. the time for which the pulse is ON). Consecutive ON and OFF in a pulse is known as the duty cycle which can be calculated by the following equations.

Duty cycle (%) = (tON x 100) / Period

= (tON x 100) / (tON + tOFF)

PWM signal is commonly used to control devices such as speed of DC motor or brightness of the bulb. The advantages of PWM signal are: reduces energy loss due to constant stimulation and can be connected to a microcontroller which can further be connected to the computer and give power to the device.  Duty cycle adjustment is easy to make. Furthermore, the PWM signal is used to send commands to devices such as RC servo motor and so on.

### Generate PWM signal 
we will create a function SetPWM which takes as parameter TIM_HandleTypeDef timer (number of timer used), uint32_t channel (number of PWM Channel used), uint16_t period (period = ton + toff), uint16_t pulse (ton).and in this function we will re-configure the TIM4 and finally generate the PWM signal with a period and a variable pulse.

```C++
void SetPWM(TIM_HandleTypeDef timer, uint32_t channel, uint16_t period, uint16_t pulse) 
{ 
  HAL_TIM_PWM_Stop(&timer, channel);    
// stop generation of pwm
  TIM_OC_InitTypeDef sConfigOC; 
	timer.Init.Prescaler = 0;
  timer.Init.Period = period;           
// set the period duration
  HAL_TIM_PWM_Init(&timer);  
// reinititialise with new period value
  sConfigOC.OCMode = TIM_OCMODE_PWM1; 
  sConfigOC.Pulse = pulse;              
// set the pulse duration 
  sConfigOC.OCPolarity = TIM_OCPOLARITY_HIGH; 
  sConfigOC.OCFastMode = TIM_OCFAST_DISABLE; 
  HAL_TIM_PWM_ConfigChannel(&timer, &sConfigOC, channel); 
  HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&timer, channel);   
// start pwm generation
} 
```
#### Example of using this function period = 255 and variable pulse
```C++
		for(int i=0; i<256; i++)
		{
			SetPWM(htim4, TIM_CHANNEL_1, 255, i); 
			HAL_Delay(25); 
		} 
```
