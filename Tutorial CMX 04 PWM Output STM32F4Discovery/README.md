# Tutorial CMX 04 PWM Output STM32F4Discovery

### PWM Output generation on STM32 Microcontrollers using HAL
In this tutorial, I will show you, how to implement PWM outputs on STM32F4xx devices. This is for a lot of people pretty hard work, but believe me, itâ€™s quite quick and easy. I will go step by step on how to make a PWM output on specific timer.

I used the following equipment:

- STM32F4 Discovery Board.
- Keil uVision 5 with the necessary packages for STM32F4 Discovery boards installed.
- STLink USB Driver.
- STM 32 CubeMX.

### STM32CubeMX 

Generating the config. files from STM32CubeMX.  

1. Open STM32CubeMX and open a new project. 
2. Select the STM32F4 Discovery from the Borards tab.
3. Set and configure the RCC (HSE) to Crystal/Ceramic Resonator.
4. Set and configure TIM4 as PWM Generation CH1 (correspond to PD12 PIN).

6. Click the configuration tab and click on the TIM4 button 
7. The TIM4 is configured in PWM 1 mode and the pulsation is 0 (the upper code is dragged into the main code), the fast mode is deactivated and the polarity is set high.
